1. `NextJS` - for server-side rendering or static side genaration to the served client whichever is more optimized approach at a given time and implmenting React under the hood for creating and implementing reusable custom components and serving the site.

2. `TypeScript` - for defining types for the objects and data members exhanged between the apollo client and graphql server. 

3. `GraphQL` -  Utilized to make the backend APIs fast, flexible, and developer-friendly by fetching only data fields necessary from multiple data sources, here in this case a remote deployed postgresQL Database. Used Query and Mutations in the graph server for CRUDifying the PostgresQL instance.

4. `Apollo Client` - Implemented Apollo Client to define,implement and utilize the server side graphQL Queries and Mutations. Implemenented in memory caching to opimize the entire User experience by making the time intensive DB round trip only when necessary.  

2. `NextAuth` - for implementing OAuth 2.0 Google Strategy.
